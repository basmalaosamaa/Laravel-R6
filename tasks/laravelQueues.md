<h1>Using Queues in Laravel</h1>
<p>Queues are used to execute tasks that take a long time to complete, such as uploading videos and sending emails. This allows for the postponement of tasks that utilize application resources, leading to improved response and loading times, which are fundamental to the success of any website. They also positively impact search engine optimization and user experience.

<em>For example:</em> When sending an email, we notice that the time taken between clicking the send button and the appearance of the success message is 6 seconds. The user is not directed to the page and shown the success message until the email has been sent, and it is not logical for an app visitor to wait this long. To eliminate the waiting time, Laravel allows us to use Queues. </p>

<em>Laravel provides us with a variety of options for using queues, such as database, Redis, SQS, and Beanstalkd.. The default queue connection is database. </em>

<p>Using a Queue does not speed up the process of sending emails, but it does enhance the response time and the appearance of the message indicating that the email has been sent. It handles the email sending in the background, without the website visitor noticing, by creating jobs: A Queue is created using Artisan commands :

<ul>php artisan queue:table</ul>
<ul>php artisan migrate</ul>

After executing the command, a migration file will be created that will handle the jobs table, as all the queues will be stored in the jobs table.To create a Queue using Artisan commands.

<p>As we know how to send emails using Laravel, it was done without using a Queue. Here, we will add a Queue to send the messages, and to do this, we need to create a job to handle the sent messages:</p>
<ul>php artisan make:job SendEmailJob</ul>
After executing the command, a class app/jobs/SendEmailJob will be created. </p>

<p>In the controller, instead of creating an instance of the mailable class in the function responsible for sending the email, a dispatch will be made for the SendEmailJob.</p>
